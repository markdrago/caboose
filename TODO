value:
- make % of code in a given subset of dirs stat work w/ config
  X perhaps add ability to have a stat which is not written to index
  - then have a stat which reads from already-written results files

tech debt:
- grep for TODO

bugs:
- It may be possible for 2 stats to run far enough apart that when the time
  offset is used to find an old revision that they'll end up with 2 different
  revisions.  If these 2 stats are then used in a results_stat the timestamps
  of their data points will not match and it won't work.  I haven't seen this
  happen, but I'm pretty sure it would.
