value:
- figure out how to get >1 plot on one graph in a sane way
- create output directory if it does not exist
- add ability to move more config options up to global level

tech debt:
- grep for TODO
- make output_directory global option work like other globals (distributable)

bugs:
- It may be possible for 2 stats to run far enough apart (at run-time) that
  when the time offset is used to find an old revision they'll end up with 2
  different revisions.  If these 2 stats are then used in a results_stat the
  timestamps of their data points will not match and it won't work.  I haven't
  seen this happen, but I'm pretty sure it would.  The fix I'm imagining would
  be to save a 'starting time' at the beginning of execution and have every
  stat use that as its starting time.
