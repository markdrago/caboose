value:
- figure out how to get >1 plot on one graph in a sane way
- create output directory if it does not exist
- make results_files config option relative to output directory
- add results stat which will sum the results of two other stats
- maintain 'latest' symlink to most recent dated stats output directory

tech debt:
- grep for TODO
- make output_directory global option work like other globals (distributable)
  - possibly move global stat options in to an element (global_stat...)
